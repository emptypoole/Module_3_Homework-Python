PyBank is code to take the data from a csv file and find Profit and Loss data from certain months.

PyPoll is code to take the data from a csv file and find the votes for certain election candidates and who is the winner of the election.

The source csv files can be found in the corresponding Resources folders, and the text file outputs can be found in the corresponding Analysis folder.

I found how to write to a text file from Python here: https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-write-text-file/

I was able to find how to increment a dictionary value for PyPoll using get() here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-increment-value-in-dictionary/
